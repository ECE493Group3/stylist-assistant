### Introduction

The Stylist Assistant is a companion for stylists and their clients. In the industry today, personal stylists work with their clients closely, often on a daily basis, helping them achieve the client’s desired personal style goal. This makes being a personal stylist a full-time job, and hiring a personal stylist very expensive. Hence, participation in the industry is limited.

Stylist Assistant uses AI to help stylists with clients’ daily style. Reducing the time commitment of the personal stylist reduces time and cost barriers for clients, thus increasing participation in the industry. 

The project as it stands relies on stylists to help the app build reliably fashionable pieces tailored to the client’s style goal. It is possible to have the system work without the stylist if a sufficiently large and complex database existed. However, featuring the stylist in the app allows more potential avenues of growth for the industry, similar to that of the personal training industry where trainers have their own sponsorship deals, or create their own products and communities. The barrier to entry for stylists and potential clients limits the personal stylist industry from this type of growth. 

The project’s potential to disrupt and grow the industry to a large degree makes it a potentially revolutionary technology.
